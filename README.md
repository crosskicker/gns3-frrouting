# FRRouting with GNS3

## Overview

In this project you will find a Dockerfile to build a clean frrouting image to use in GNS3, you can directly pull the image from my docker repo. This Dockerfile is espacially for a gns3 use case ! If you want to have image with a clean FRRouting configuration for just a Docker use case ( as in project with Docker compose ) go to my other repository.

It's the latest version of FRRouting, to configure different protocoles you just need to enter in router configuration with "vtysh" command, for the next respect the configuration of FRR.

https://docs.frrouting.org/en/stable-10.1/overview.html

This version of FRRouting doesn't have many .conf file but just a single one "frr.conf"

The router configuration can be saved be saved with "write memory" ( thanks to volumes configure in Dockerfile ) so the memory isn't volatile.
